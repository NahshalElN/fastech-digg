# Fastech Frontend Task

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


To install this application, run:

### `npm install`

Install all dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Also:
### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\


The app is built using react and tailwindcss, it is a simple multistep form made with a switch statement (Home.js) that renders specific form components based on overall form completion progress. Has a simple form validation (i.e, ineffective), all the variables are stored in a state (no context or redux) so they will be destroyed when you leave the page/refresh.
